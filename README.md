# 🍇 Raisin Variety Classification (Logistic Regression)

This project trains a Logistic Regression model to classify raisin varieties (Kecimen vs Besni) using the Raisin Dataset.

## 📊 Steps
1. Load Raisin Dataset (`Raisin_Dataset.xlsx`).
2. Train-test split (80:20).
3. Standardization of features.
4. Logistic Regression with 5-fold Cross Validation.
5. Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## ✅ Results
- Mean CV Accuracy: ~0.84  
- Test Accuracy: ~0.82 (≥ 81% required ✅)

## 🛠 Tools
- Google Colab  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
